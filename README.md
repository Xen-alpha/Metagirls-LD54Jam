# Metagirls - Jam Edition

Developed with Unreal Engine 5(currently blueprints only but can be extended to VS2022 project).

This is created for Ludum Dare 54 Jam entry.
The project codename is Project Homunculus(Project file name).

Target Platform: Windows, Linux, Android(Planned)

This was originally planned for my personal game development project since 2014 but I abandoned the project for 9 years because of some academic issues like university admission.
But Ludum Dare 54 gave me a reviving opportunity for this project.
This is why I opt out Graphics Ratings in LD54 for this game - some image assets are pre-made one in late 2014.

Frontier Edition will be developed later, adding Story Event and lots of stages.
