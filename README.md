# Metagirls - Jam Edition

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

This is created for Ludum Dare 54 Jam entry.
The project codename is Project Homunculus.

Target Platform: Windows, Linux(Planned), Android(Planned)

This was originally planned for my personal game development project since 2014 and I made some assets that time.
I abandoned the project for 9 years but Ludum Dare 54 give me a reviving opportunity for this project.
This is why I opt out Graphics Ratings in LD54 for this game -some image assets are pre-made one in late 2014.

Frontier Edition are reserved, adding Story Event and lots of stages.
